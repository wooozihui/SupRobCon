# SupRobCon

This is the code of our new work " A simple supervised robust constrastive learning framework " (temporary)

This code is based on pytorch and well supports the pytorch ddp training.

## Preparation
For now, this code only supports the CIFAR-10 dataset, and there is a script "setup.sh" to 
automatic make the dir "data" and put download the dataset into it.
Just run as:
```
git clone https:/github.com/wooozihui/SupRobCon
cd SupRobCon
./setup.sh
```
